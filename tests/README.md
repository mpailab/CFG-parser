# Pylext testing

Use [test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/contents.html) framework to write tests for pylext.

## Requirements

To write tests, youâ€™ll need to install pytest. As with most Python packages, you can install pytest in a virtual environment from PyPI using pip:
```shell
$ python -m pip install pytest
```
The pytest command will now be available in your installation environment.

## Testing:

When package pylext is in your installation environment, run
```shell
$ pytest
```
If we need more details, run
```shell
$ pytest -v
```

## Write tests

Your test files
- should be located in directory `test` or its subdirectories;
- must have unique names of the form `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, because pytest will search for these files and import them as top-level modules;
- must contain test items:
   * `test` prefixed test functions or methods outside of class,
   * `test` prefixed test functions or methods inside `Test` prefixed test classes (without an __init__ method).
